\section{Problem 42}

$E_{u_n}(x)$ will produce a y in the range $2^n$.  Since there are $2^m$ possible x values, then $E_{u_n}(x)$ is not one-to-one.  Thus, there must be some form of "padding" or other method of converting the n-bit string to at least m-bits to make $E_{u_n}(x)$ one-to-one.  This padding must be trivial, which means some number of bits (greater than 0) must be non-random.  Since some portion of the key is non-random, the distributions of $E_{u_n}(x)$ and $E_{u_n}(x')$ are not equal.


\section{Problem 43}

Assume $f$ is a one-way permutation.  After $f(x)$, the result is some random permutation of x (having n bits).  After k iterations of permuting these strings, the result is still some random permutation.  $f(x)$ runs in polynomial time.  Therefore, $f^k(x)$ is a one-way permutation.
