\section{Problem 18}
\subsection{Part b}
Player 2 has the winning strategy.  There exist values Player 2 can choose such that no matter what choices Player 1 chooses, Player 2 can make a winning move.

If Player 1 chooses $w=F$, they cannot pick $y=T$ because Player 2 can pick $z=T$, causing the 2nd clause to be false (going the way of $C_{2}$).  If Player 1 chooses $w=T$, they cannot pick $y=F$ because Player 2 can pick $x=F$, causing the 3rd clause to be false (going the way of $C_{3}$).

If Player 1 chooses $w=F$ and $y=F$ (since the latter is forced), Player 2 can pick $x=F$ and $z=F$, causing the 1st clause to be false (going the way of $C_{1}$).  If Player 1 chooses $w=T$ and $y=T$ (since the latter is forced), Player 2 can pick $x=F$ and $z=F$, causing the 1st clause to be false (going the way of $C_{1}$).  Since all cases of values Player 1 picks leads to Player 2 winning, there does not exist values which Player 1 can play such that they will win.  Therefore, Player 2 has the winning strategy in this game.
